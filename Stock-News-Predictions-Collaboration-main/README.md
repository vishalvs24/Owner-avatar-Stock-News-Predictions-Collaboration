# Stock Analysis Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Stock Analysis Project! In this project, we aim to analyze and visualize stock market data to gain insights into various stocks' performance over time. The project utilizes Python for data analysis, along with popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** We gather stock data from reliable financial APIs, such as Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance.
  
- **Data Processing:** We use Pandas to clean and preprocess the raw data, handling missing values and ensuring consistency.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Our project includes Jupyter Notebooks with detailed EDA to understand stock trends, historical prices, and trading volumes.

- **Visualizations:** Matplotlib is employed to create informative visualizations, including line charts, candlestick plots, and moving averages.

- **Technical Analysis:** We implement various technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI) to aid in decision-making processes.
